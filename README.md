# Daily_Leetcode

This is a repository to track my solutions to leetcode problems. I am focusing mostly on specific data structure problems (array, linked lists, graphs, min/max heaps, etc...) and then
will move into Dynamic Programming and D&C Problems. My goal is to eventually implement a minimum of 100 Medium problems in Python, C++, and one more language TBD.
* Current progress: 20 Mediums

I'm slightly behind adding all my completed problems to this repository, but slowly adding them :)
